"Bringing installation scripts to new levels of simplicity and non-existence"

I can't write those fancy scripts that go on for pages and pages, so this is how to install interclient on an xinetd system such as Redhat Linux 7.1:

Put interserver in /opt/interbase/interclient or change the xinetd.d/interserver to point to where you put it.

Put interclient somewhere convenient for your application and add it to your applications classpath

Put xinetd.d/interserver in /etc/xinetd.d

As root, run kill -s SIGUSR2 `pidof xinetd`

Who knows, maybe it worked!
