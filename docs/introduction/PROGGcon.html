<H2>Opening a Database Connection</H2>
After loading the driver (or explicitly creating one), you can open a connection
to the database. There are two ways to do this: with the DriverManager's
<B>getConnection()</B> method or the driver object's <B>connect()</B> method.
<H3>
Using the DriverManager to Get a Connection</H3>
When you want to access a database, you can get a <B>java.sql.Connection</B>
object from the JDBC management layer's <B>java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection()</B>
method. The <B>getConnection()</B> method takes a URL string and a <B>java</B>.<B>util</B>.<B>Properties</B>
object as arguments. For each connection request, the DriverManager uses
the URL to locate a driver that can connect to the database represented
by the URL. If the connection is successful, a <B>java.sql.Connection</B>
object is returned. The following example shows the syntax for establishing
a database connection:
<PRE>
Class.forName ("interbase.interclient.Driver");
Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection (url,properties);
</PRE>
The <B>Connection</B> object in turn provides access to all of the InterClient
classes and methods that allow you to execute SQL statements and get back
the results.

<H3>
Defining Connection Parameters</H3>
The arguments to <B>connect</B>() or <B>getConnection</B>() must be defined
before trying to create the connection. They are the database <I>URL</I>
and the <I>connection properties</I>.
<H4>
Syntax for Specifying Database URLs</H4>
InterClient follows the JDBC standard for specifying databases using URLs.
The JDBC URL standard provides a framework so that different drivers can
use different naming systems that are appropriate for their own needs.
Each driver only needs to understand its own URL naming syntax; it can
reject any other URLs that it encounters. A JDBC URL is structured as follows:
<PRE>jdbc:subprotocol:subname</PRE>
The <I>subprotocol</I> names a particular kind of database connection,
which is in turn supported by one or more database drivers. The DriverManager
decides which driver to use based on which subprotocol is registered for
each driver. The contents and syntax of <I>subname</I> in turn depend upon
the <I>subprotocol</I>. If the network address is included in the <I>subname</I>,
the naming convention for the <I>subname</I> is:
<PRE>//hostname:/subsubname</PRE>
<I>subsubname</I> can have any arbitrary syntax.
<H4>
Defining an InterClient URL</H4>
InterClient URLs have the following format:
<PRE>jdbc:interbase://<I>server</I>/<I>full_db_path</I></PRE>
"interbase"<I> </I>is the subprotocol, and <I>server </I>is the hostname
of the InterBase server. <I>Full_db_path </I>(i.e., "subsubname") is the
full pathname of a database file, including the server's root (/) directory.
If the InterBase server is a Windows NT system, you must include the drive
name as well. InterClient doesn't support passing any attributes in the
URL. For local connections, use:
<PRE>server = "localhost"</PRE>

<DL>
<DT>
<DFN><B>Note</B>: The "/" between the server and full_db_path is treated
as a delimiter only. When specifying the path for a Unix-based database,
you must include the initial "/" for the root directory in addition to
the "/" for the delimiter.</DFN></DT>
</DL>

<H4>
Examples</H4>
For example, with a Unix-based database, the URL
<PRE>dbURL = "jdbc:interbase://accounts//dbs/orders.gdb"</PRE>
refers to the database "orders.gdb" in the directory "/dbs" on the Unix
server "accounts." 
<p>
The URL
<PRE>dbURL = "jdbc:interbase://support/C:/dbs/customer.gdb"</PRE>
refers to the database "customer.gdb" in the directory "/dbs" on drive
C of the Wings or Win95 or NT server "support."
<H4>
Defining the Connection Properties</H4>
Connection properties must also be defined before trying to open a database
connection. To do this, you pass in a <B>java.util.Properties</B> object,
which maps between tag strings and value strings. Two typical properties
are "user" and "password." First, create the <B>Properties</B> object:
<PRE>java.util.Properties properties = new java.util.Properties();</PRE>
Now create the connection arguments. <I>user </I>and <I>password</I> are
either literal strings or string variables. They must be the username and
password on the InterBase database that you are connecting to:
<PRE>properties.put ("user", user);

properties.put ("password", password);</PRE>
Now create the connection with the URL and connection properties parameters:
<PRE>Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection(url, properties);</PRE>

<H3>
Security</H3>
Client applications use standard database user name and password verification
to access an InterBase database. InterClient encrypts the user name and
password for transmission over the network.

the InterClient examples directory.
