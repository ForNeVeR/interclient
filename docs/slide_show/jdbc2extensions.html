<h1>JDBC 2 Standard Extension API</h1>
</center>
<p>
Specification to be released for public review Summer 98
<p>
<small><small><i>
Still in javasoft partner review, but should be released soon
for public review.
<p>
More advanced than core api, and generally depends on modules provided by the other
java extension apis, especially enterprise java beans.
The java extension interfaces exist in the suite of javax packages,
so for example, the jdbc 2 standard extension interfaces exists in package javax.sql,
the enterprise transaction interfaces exist in package javax.transaction.
The javax packages will be employeed extensively by enterprise java beans.
Enterprise java beans is a server-side component model, whereas java beans
are a client-side component model.
<p>
Each one of these is a major topic in itself but i've prepared a brief
overview for each topic.
</i></small></small>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Rowsets<br>
<small><small><i>
If you think of a result set as a cursor, then think of
a rowset as a self-contained collection of rows, disconnected
from a database connection.
So rowsets are always scrollable, and even more important,
a rowset may be serialized to disk.
That is, a rowset is a serializable java bean.
A rowset can be used while disconnected from the database.
A rowset is a container for tabular data that's updatable and serializable
and can even be moved around the network independently from any
database connection.  As tabular self-contained data, a rowset can even
come from non-SQL data sources.  No locks are maintained by the database;
when changes need to be propagated back to the
database, an optimistic concurrency algorithm is used
which ensures the original values of the rowset were not changed
while the rowset was disconnected from the database.
If changes to the original database values represented by a rowset do occur,
an update conflict is issued and nothing is updated.
Think of a rowset as a disconnected, serializable, updatable
self contained java bean for tabular data.
As a java bean, it can be stored to disk at will and restored at will,
and be used at design time in a visual builder.
<p>
Rowsets also allow multiple cursors on its data.
But the main difference from a result set is
that for a rowset, all of it's rows are completely cached,
so it exists independently from the database.
<p>
Not all rowsets are updatable, many dbms vendors are unable to dynamically determine
the table from which a result column originated, so the jdbc 2 specification doesn't require joins
to be updatable, some of which could be.
InterClient will support updates on rowsets created thru joins provided
a unique row identifier is selected for each joined table.
</i></small></small>
<li>Connection pooling<br>
<small><small><i>
The idea behind connection pooling is to reuse database connections.
This is important when there are many connections coming and going
regularly from a client. When a connection is closed,
rather than just closing the physical connection to the database, the connection
can be put into a connection pool for possible reuse by another
client, or another thread wishing to establish a connection to the
same database.
How long it remains in the pool depends on your pooling algorithm.
A driver can implement its own pool, but it's only aware of its
own connections, so it can only pool connections created by that driver.
But there could be several drivers on the client, with heterogenous
data sources.  So jdbc 2 will include
a pooling module that will sit on top of jdbc, and manage a collective
pool so to speak for all jdbc drivers on the client.  So each driver
will implement certain hooks that allow the pooling module to get at
its pooled connections, and the driver will notify the pooling
module on top of jdbc whenever it is finished with a connection.
<p>
Sun provides the interfaces for the connection pooling module which
resides on top of jdbc, but does not provide an implementation.
Pooling modules will be provided by 3rd party vendors, and they'll probably
be integrated with transaction servers.
<p>
Pooling modules are meant to
be used by enterprise java beans.
</i></small></small>
<li>XA distributed transactions<br>
<small><small><i>
This is a two phase commit protocol implemented underneath of the XA resources interface.
<p>
This is similarly architecturally to connection pooling, in that any one
particular driver can only be aware of its own connections in a
distributed transaction, so to allow for heterogeneous data sources,
there are hooks that must be implemented by each driver,
and a transaction module, aka java transaction service (JTS),
sits on top of jdbc.
<p>
The hooks that need to be implemented are essentially two-phase commit.
So the driver implements the two phase commit protocol with methods
such as prepare, commit, abort which operate across multiple connections.
Please note that this is driver functionality.
Two-phase commit is implemented in the client library.
InterClient implements its own client library and cannot
rely on the two-phase commit protocol implemented in the
InterBase C client library.  
<p>
Like connection pooling, a driver's implementatoin of two phase commit only
allows it to manage distributed connections within the driver itself.
The transaction module, which is known as a java transaction service,
allows distributed transactions which span multiple drivers or even non-jdbc
data sources!  So the JTS can coordinate activities across heterogeneous
data sources.  The JTS is a standard java mapping
of the OMG Object Transaction Service (OTS) which is meant to be used
by a CORBA orb for managing transactions. So interclient-xa can
be used either by CORBA distributed transactions or
by Enterprise Java Beans.
Visibroker has its own integrated transaction service.
<p>
The enterprise java beans component architecture allows a server bean to
perform distributed transactions seamlessly across heterogenous data sources
using a JTS.  The enterprise java beans themselves will be able to communicate either using
RMI or RMI over IIOP so that enterprise java beans can fully interoperate with CORBA applications.
This technology is expected to be released for early access
this summer as a java standard extension.
</i></small></small>
<li>JNDI name service support<br>
<small><small><i>
InterClient will support the Java Naming and Directory Interface as an alternative
way of naming databases to the standard jdbc 1 database url naming conventions.
With the current methods in jdbc 1, an application has to explicitly
load any particular drivers it may need (eg. Class.forName()), and when an application needs to get
a connection, it has to specify a jdbc subprotocol which is also specific to a particular
driver (eg. jdbc:interbase:).
The idea with JNDI is to free the application from having to make these decisions,
and put the information about what driver should be used with what database
into some kind of naming service repository.  So a database could be moved from
one machine to the next, and only the name repository would have to change, not
the application.
The JNDI is simply an interface that interclient will plug into for accessing directory
service information provided by some JNDI service provider implementation such as LDAP.
I'm not sure what the format of the data stored will be,
but it should provide
for driver independence, at least in the jdbc application.
The naming service will attach a particular driver to use for a particular database,
and there will be some kind of logical name associated with the database.
<p>
Notice that a name service provides a server-side registry of databases,
rather than the client-side aliases we're used to from ODBC and BDE.
<p>
A jndi url would be something like "jdbc:interbase:jndi:LDAP_hostname:port_number/...".
The jndi service provider implementation could use an LDAP server (lightweight directory access protocol).
