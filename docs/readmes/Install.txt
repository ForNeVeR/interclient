Important Note for JBuilder Users

   Please exit JBuilder before continuing with the InterClient install.
   JBuilder must *not* be running in order for the InterClient
   Install to properly modify JBuilder INI settings.
   For information on configuring INI settings manually, see the
   file JBuilderNotes.txt after installation.

__________________________________________________________________
Installation Note for Windows NT, 95/98, and 2000

   If you have a previous release of InterClient installed on
   this machine, you MUST uninstall it before continuing.

   If you receive a General File Transfer Error during install,
   try to obtain more disk space for both your InterClient install
   location as well as your JBuilder install location to which
   InterClient documentation files get written.

__________________________________________________________________
Uninstalling on Windows NT, 95/98, and 2000

   Before uninstalling, you should first stop the InterServer
   service or application if it is running, and then remove the
   service using the InterServer Configuration Utility.

   When uninstalling on NT, use the add/remove program icon in
   the NT control panel.  On Windows 95, there is an uninstall
   icon in the InterClient program group if InterServer was
   previously installed.

__________________________________________________________________
Installation Options

   During installation you will be prompted to choose components
   to install.  By default all of the following components are
   installed:

     InterClient
       The pure Java JDBC client library which communicates with
       a server-side InterServer.
     InterServer
       A remote access server for InterBase.  This is a middleware
       service which acts as a proxy between InterClient and InterBase.
       The service is tailored for InterBase remote access via JDBC.
     Documentation
       HTML documentation for the all-Java InterClient JDBC driver.

__________________________________________________________________
Distributed Jar Files

   interclient-core.jar
      The JDBC driver with only the default English text resources.
      No utilities included in the core jar.
   interclient-res.jar
      Locale-specific resource bundles.
   interclient-utils.jar
      Currently consists of the communications diagnostics utility.
   interclient.jar
      Everything: JDBC driver, all resources, and utilities.

   The Windows install automatically appends interclient.jar
   to your user's classpath.  You must modify your classpath
   manually on Unix.

__________________________________________________________________
Testing your Local Installation

   See the Troubleshooting section of the InterClient Help html for
   detailed instructions on testing your machine configuration for
   running InterClient applications using

     java interbase.interclient.utils.CommDiag

   and for instructions on testing your applet configuration using

     CommDiag.html

__________________________________________________________________
Software Expiration

   This release of InterClient will expire, but continue to
   function, on December 30, 2005.

   Expired product releases of InterClient accept connections,
   but the connection is tagged with an ExpiredDriverWarning.
   Expired beta releases of InterClient may throw an
   ExpiredDriverException and refuse connections.

   Upon expiration, it is suggested that you upgrade both InterClient
   and InterServer driver components by downloading a recent release
   from http://www.interbase.com.

Installation Note for Solaris and HP-UX

   After the download files have been extracted using the tar
   command (eg. tar -xvf IC20HPJRE11.tar), a directory is created
   named interclient_install_temp_dir containing the following files:

     install.sh      : the installation program
     interclient.tar : components to be extracted by install.sh

   The installation process creates a log file of the installation
   session.  It is important to retain the log file in the
   installation directory.
    - It contains the configuration information specific to your
      site necessary to complete the installation.
    - It contains a log of your installation choices. It may be
      helpful should you require technical support.

   The following entry must occur in the /etc/services file or
   the NIS services map:

     interserver 3060/tcp

   An entry in the /etc/inetd.conf file is also required:

     interserver stream tcp nowait root /usr/interclient/bin/interserver 
interserver

   After adding these entries, either reboot the system or restart the
   inet daemon.  To restart the inet daemon, use the ps command to
   discover the process id of the inetd process:

      ps -e | grep inetd
   or
      ps -ax | grep inetd

   The number in the output column 'PID' is the process id of the inet
   daemon.  Use the process id with the following command to restart the
   inet daemon:

     kill -HUP <PID>

   After installing, be sure to add /usr/interclient/interclient.jar
   to your CLASSPATH.
