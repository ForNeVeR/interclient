<a name="a"><h4>Testing your Local Installation</h4></a>

<p>
  First, verify that the installation has appended your
  CLASSPATH with the interclient.jar file.

<p>
  Second, on Windows NT/95, select the InterServer Configuration 
  Utility icon in the InterClient program group and start the
  InterServer service or application (usually, but not necessarily,
  on your InterBase server).  On Unix the interserver service is 
  started automatically by inetd if your <code>/etc/services</code> and 
  <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> are configured properly.

<p>
  Finally, on Windows NT/95, select the Communication Diagnostics
  icon from the InterClient program group.  If Java is installed
  on your local machine and interclient.jar is in your CLASSPATH,
  then a GUI will appear for making a test connection using the
  locally installed driver.  Alternatively, and on Unix, you may
  invoke the Communication Diagnostics Utility from the command line
  using
<pre>
    java interbase.interclient.utils.CommDiag
</pre>

<p>
<a name="b"><h4>Testing an Applet Configuration</h4></a>

<p>
  CommDiag may also be run as an applet on clients in which neither
  the JDK nor InterClient is installed.  Using a Java enabled browser,
  browse CommDiag.html off a web server
  which has InterClient deployed.  If you run InterClient applets
  such as CommDiag through a browser, then you may need to remove the 
  interclient.jar from your local CLASSPATH to avoid a
  security exception.
  A browser's default security policy may only allow socket connections
  to the host which is the source of the class file
  which is attempting the connection.
  So the security manager needs to be sure that the source host of the
  downloaded InterClient class files is the same as 
  the database server host.
  If the interclient.jar is being picked up from your local disk,
  rather than being downloaded along with an applet such as CommDiag,
  then this may be difficult for the security manager to determine.

<p>
  You may also run CommDiag through the appletviewer.

<p>
  On Unix:
<pre>
    unset CLASSPATH
    appletviewer CommDiag.html
</pre>
  On Windows 95/NT:
<pre>
    set CLASSPATH=
    appletviewer CommDiag.html
</pre>
  You may need to unset your CLASSPATH temporarily in your command
  session when viewing a local applet; otherwise you could receive a
  java.lang.IllegalAccessError.  CommDiag.html contains
  an applet tag which references the interclient.jar archive.

<p>
  Depending on your browser's security policy, untrusted applets may
  not be allowed to open network connections to arbitrary hosts, 
  except for the host that provided the .class files. 
  This is either the host where the html page came from, 
  or the host specified in the codebase parameter in the applet tag,
  with codebase taking precendence. Under this security policy, 
  untrusted applets will only operate if InterServer is installed on the same web 
  server host that serves the interclient.jar file.  If you choose
  to deploy InterServer on another host then you may need to digitally
  sign your applet together with the interclient.jar file so
  that the entire applet is trusted.
  InterServer is *not* involved in the certification process,
  its an issue between the browser and the downloaded jar.
  Browsers are all configured differently, so see the
  vendor-specific documentation for your browser.
  Some browsers (e.g. HotJava) can be configured to allow
  arbitrary socket connections even for untrusted applets,
  others (e.g. Netscape) have their own proprietary security
  api to allow an untrusted applet to request privileges from
  the browser.

<p>
  Be sure to name the originating host exactly as it was specified 
  when the applet was loaded into the browser. 
  That is, if you load an HTML page using the URL 
<pre>
    http://foo.state.edu/~me/CommDiag.html
</pre>
  then your applet will be able to connect to its host only by using
  the name foo.state.edu in the jdbc URL
<pre>
    jdbc:interbase://foo.state.edu//databases/employee.gdb
</pre>
  Using the IP address for foo.state.edu won't work, and using a
  "shorthand" form of the host name, like foo.state instead of 
  foo.state.edu, won't work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="c"><h4>Troubleshooting the "No suitable driver" exception</h4></a>

<p>
This exception is issued by the JDBC Driver Manager and
usually occurs during a call to DriverManager.getConnection().
The cause can be failing to load the appropriate JDBC driver before calling
getConnection(), or specifying an invalid JDBC URL - one that isn't
recognized by any loaded JDBC driver. 

<p>
This error can also occur due to a bug in the JDK 1.1.x
with Class.forName().  Because of a race condition in 
the class loader, it is sometimes possible that the class loader
is prevented from executing the static section of code
in the driver class.  This would prevent the loaded driver
class from registering itself with the driver manager.
So Class.forName () may appear to succeed with no exception thrown,
but the driver may not be registered with the driver manager.
A work around is to obtain a connection from an explicitly constructed
driver instance as follows:
<pre> 
java.sql.Driver d = new interbase.interclient.Driver ();
java.sql.Connection c = d.connect ("jdbc:interbase://server/c:/databases/atlas.gdb", 
                                   "sysdba", "masterkey");
</pre>

<p>
Here are some typical reasons for getting the <i>no suitable driver</i> error:
<ul>
<li> The InterClient driver is not in your CLASSPATH.
  <ul>
  <li> If you're working with Sun's JDK, then make
       sure the correct file specifiation for
       interclient.jar is in your system's CLASSPATH environment variable.
  <li> If you're working with JBuilder, then make sure that your project property setting
       for Class Path has the correct file specification for interclient.jar.
       Choose <i>File | Project Properties</i> to view these properties.
       Also check your JBuilder.INI file and see the 
       JBuilder Integration Notes that come with InterClient.
  </ul>
<li> The InterClient driver has not been loaded.
  <ul>
  <li> Check your spelling and capitalization of the InterClient driver name.<br> 
       Make sure you specify interbase.interclient.Driver with the capital D.<br>
       For example,
       <pre>
       Class.forName ("interbase.interclient.Driver");
       </pre>
  </ul>
<li> The InterClient driver does not recognize the database URL syntax.
  <ul>
  <li>Check the subprotocol in the URL.<br>
     URLs for InterClient must start with jdbc:interbase:<br>
     For example,
     <pre>
     DriverManager.getConnection ("jdbc:interbase://server/c:/databases/atlas.gdb", ...);
     </pre>
  </ul>
<li> The InterClient driver has not been registered.
  <ul> 
  <li> The class loader bug in JDK 1.1.x was encountered.  See notes above.
  </ul>
</ul>
Finally, try using the Communication Diagnostics program that comes with InterClient and
see if you can connect that way.

<p>
<a name="d"><h4>Troubleshooting "Access is denied" when trying to start the InterServer service</h4></a>

<p>
Only one customer has reported this problem, and its
cause is currently unknown.
If you encounter this problem, please send email to
<a href="mailto:interclient@interbase.com">interclient@interbase.com</a>.

<p>
<a name="e"><h4>Deciphering messages logged to the interserver.log file</h4></a>

<p>
In general, interserver errors are relayed back to
InterClient and surfaced via an SQLException.
However, if the socket is unexpectedly disconnected,
or some other error occurs on the socket,
then relay of the error message back to the client
over the same socket may be impossible.
So the purpose of the interserver.log file is 
for the logging of messages that
cannot be relayed back to InterClient.

<p>
Messages logged to the interserver.log file are
usually innocuous and caused by client application
neglect to close the socket gracefully using
the 
<a href="../specifications/interbase/interclient/Connection.html#close">Connection.close()</a>
or <a href="../specifications/interbase/interclient/ServerManager.html#close">ServerManager.close()</a> methods.
InterServer spends its idle time waiting
for requests from InterClient.  If InterClient
terminates abruptly without using Connection.close()
then InterServer will detect an error on the socket,
and log a message to the interserver.log file.
This is of no real concern to the user, as 
the connection is closed, just not in a graceful
manner.

<p>
However, socket failures could be caused for 
more insidious reasons, such as someone cutting the network
wire with a pair of scissors.  In such case,
a message to interserver.log is logged since
there is no way to relay an exception back to 
InterClient.

<p>
Here are the message codes which may be logged
to the interserver.log file.  The integer code
simply indicates the exact location in the 
InterServer source where the message originated.

<table>
<tr>
<td>JDBC/Net [100-199]
<td>Unable to read bytes from socket
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JDBC/Net [200-299]
<td>Unable to write bytes to socket
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<a name="f"><h4>The Communication Diagnostics icon in the Windows InterClient Program Group does not work</h4></a>

<p>
If a version of the JDK 1.1 was not in your system PATH when
InterClient was installed, the CommDiag program group
icon will not have the correct properties.
On NT, use the Control Panel to edit the user Environment variable
PATH to include the JDK 1.1 bin directory on your system.
Also, edit the ClassPath Environment variable and include
interclient.jar if it is not already present in the path.
Next, right click on the InterClient program group in the
Windows start menu and select "open".  This will bring
up the InterClient program group icons in a separate window.
Select the Communications Diagnostics icon, right click,
and select "properties".  Now insert "java " in front
of the class name "interbase.interclient.utils.CommDiag"
in the target location field property.
<p>
Alternatively, the Communications Diagnostics utility may also be 
run from the command-line using
<pre>
java interbase.interclient.utils.CommDiag
</pre>

<p>
<a name="g"><h4>Getting Connection Refused on high-throughput servers</h4></a>

<p>
If you send many connection requests to InterServer within a certain
timeframe,  you may experience hanging processes or "Connection refused"
error messages.  This happens because the number of requests per minutes
exceeds the maximum defined by inetd, thereby causing inetd to
mistakenly tag interserver as a broken service.  Broken services are
kept out of operation for usually ten minutes before they are allowed to
receive new connections.
<p>
The inetd super-daemon has a default maximum of 40 invocations per
minute on many operating systems, including Solaris and Linux.  These
values usually can be adjusted by the system administrator.
<p>
For Solaris, modify the startup scripts that launch inetd so that inetd
uses the -r parameter.  Refer to the Solaris documentation for details.
<p>
For Linux, modify the interserver entry in /etc/inetd.conf, changing
'nowait' to 'nowait.100' or higher.  After the changes are made, send a
hangup signal, SIGHUP, to the inetd process so that it rereads the
inetd.conf file.

<p>
<a name="h"><h4>InstallShield crashes - Access violation in _INS0432._MP</h4></a>
<p>
If you have JBuilder installed and an access violation occurs at the end
of the installation for InterClient, this may be because the
IDEClassPath setting within the JBuilder.INI file exceeds 1024 bytes.
The workaround to this problem is to edit the JBuilder.INI file manually
by following these steps:
<ol>
<li> Run regedit.exe and delete the following key:
<pre>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\InterBase Corp\InterClient
</pre>

<li> Shut down JBuilder if it is running. Open the JBuilder.ini file with
a text editor.  You can find this file in the JBuilder bin directory.
Make a backup copy of this file.  Search for a line that begins with
'IDEClassPath' and change this word to 'OLDIDEClassPath'.  Insert a line
above this one that reads 'IDEClassPath=x'. Save the file.

<li> Rerun the InterClient installation program.  There should be no error
this time.

<li> After the installation is complete. Re-open the JBuilder.ini file
with a text editor.  You may notice that the IDEClassPath value has a
reference to the InterClient jar file.  It may look like this:
<pre>
IDEClassPath=c:\Program Files\InterBase Corp\InterClient\interclient.jar;x
</pre>
The actual path depends on where you installed InterClient. Delete the
trailing <code>x</code> in the IDEClassPath and merge this value with the
OLDIDEClassPath. The final outcome is the original IDEClassPath setting
with the InterClient jar file and an semi-colon added to it.  Save the
JBuilder.INI file.
