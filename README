The firebird/make.sh script will build interserver and will compile the 
java sources.

You currently need j2ee.jar to compile the java sources.  Set J2EE_HOME 
before running firebird/make.sh in this directory.

The firebird/makeDeliverables.sh script will create the file InterClient.tar
in the product directory.

#
# make "build" version on linux
#
IC_PLATFORM=linux; export IC_PLATFORM
IC_BUILD_DIR=`pwd`; export IC_BUILD_DIR
firebird/make.sh -build
firebird/makeDeliverables.sh -build

To install InterClient/interserver:

 1) Extract InterClient.tar to a temp[orary] directory, 

 2) cd to it  
 
   for example, 

     cd [temp]/interclient_install_temp_dir

 3) execute "install.sh" to install InterClient.
